# Dunder References in Headings

## About __init__.py

The __init__.py file is important for Python packages.

### Understanding __name__

The __name__ variable is commonly used in Python code.

## Multiple Dunders: __init__.py and __name__

You can use both __init__.py and __name__ together.

#### Private __attribute__ Variables

The __attribute__ pattern is for private variables.

### Code example with __init__.py

Here's how to use __init__.py in your project.

## Non-dunder references should pass through

The variable my_var is not affected.

### Already wrapped: `__init__.py`

If dunders are already wrapped in backticks, they should not be wrapped again.

## Dunder without .py extension

The __dict__ and __class__ attributes are special.

### Complex case: Using __init__.py in __main__.py

Both dunders on same heading should be wrapped.
