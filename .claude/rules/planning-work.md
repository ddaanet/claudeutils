# Planning Work Rules

When working on runbooks and execution plans, load relevant planning guidance:

- **Error classification taxonomy**: `@agent-core/fragments/error-classification.md`
- **Prerequisite validation patterns**: `@agent-core/fragments/prerequisite-validation.md`

These provide structured approaches to error handling and dependency verification in plan design.
