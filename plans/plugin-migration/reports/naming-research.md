# Plugin Naming Research

## Decision: `edify`

**Chosen name:** `edify` (5 chars)
**Rationale:** Latin *aedificare* = *aedes* (house/temple) + *facere* (to make). Literally "to build." Late Latin meaning shifted to "to instruct." The word IS the intersection of construction and prose — not a metaphor, the actual etymology. Building through instruction.

**Scoring:**

| Dimension | Score | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Opinionated | 2 | Edification implies knowing what's right |
| Production | 3 | Root literally means "to make/build" |
| Feedback | 2 | Edifying experiences include correction |
| Quality/Cost | 2 | Aims at improvement/betterment |
| Memory | 3 | Builds lasting knowledge |
| **Total** | **12/15** | |

**Associations:**
- 🧱 Brick, construction, solid — *aedes* = house/temple, the root IS building
- Text, structure, guidance — to edify = to instruct through words
- Prose + construction are the SAME word etymologically

**Namespace:** `/edify:commit`, `/edify:design`, `/edify:vet`
**Googlable:** Edify Corporation (banking software, dead since 2000). No current dev tool collision.
**Model affinity:** Positive, enhancing — "edify" suggests making things better through instruction

**Previous finalist:** `rubric` (13/15) — killed by Rubric Labs collision (AI company with CLI tool)

## Key Concepts (final)

1. **Prose** — the medium is written text (markdown), not traditional code
2. **Iterative expansion with corrective feedback** — grows incrementally, self-correcting
3. **Construction** — building something real and solid
4. **Continuous memory** — accumulated knowledge that persists

## Constraints (final)

- Obvious spelling — hear once, spell correctly
- Transparent purpose — developer guesses what it does
- Googlable — NOT an existing software project
- Works as namespace
- Not abbreviated, not generic, not Claude-specific
- Model affinity — name should suggest enhancement, not constraint

| `runward` | Not transparent enough |
| `condukt` | Looks like a typo |
| `squire` | Incomplete identity coverage |
| `drills` | Identity coverage weak |
| `runbook` | Too narrow — undersells broader scope |

| `temper` | "Temperamental" personal association |
| `lathe` | Lethe/death association |
| `tenet` | Misses production/automation dimension (8/15) |
| `rebar` | Purpose not transparent from name (7/15) |
| `regimen` | Strict/unpleasant diet connotation |
| `muster` | Word not widely known, opaque meaning |
| `dev-lead` | Job title pollution + personal baggage |
| `rubric` | Rubric Labs collision (AI company with CLI tool) |
| `formwork` | Not transparent enough |
| `grout` | No prose lane |

| `plumb` | No prose lane |

## Brainstorm Rounds

11 rounds total:
1. Meaningful names (steward, rigging, forge) — too common
2. Googlable fabrications (cadwyn, runward, praxium) — pretentious
3. Down-to-earth tools (rebar, runlog, rigging) — rebar liked
4. Geek culture (navi, pylons, squire) — too geeky
5. Transparent/plain (rigor, runbook, drills) — rigor liked but death connotation
6. Production metaphors (lathe, reify, forge) — lathe liked
7. Multi-dimensional (praxis, govern, steward) — praxis taken
8. Process metaphors (temper, regimen, crucible, muster) — temper led at 14/15 then killed
9. Capability compounds (dev-lead, dev-doctrine, code-steward) — rubric emerged then killed by collision
10. Technical concepts (precept, briefwork, dossier) — precept strong but preachy
11. Language + building intersection (edify, plumb, scribe, joinery) — edify: the word IS the intersection
