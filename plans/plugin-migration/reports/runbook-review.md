# Runbook Review: plugin-migration

**Scope**: Cross-phase consistency, metadata accuracy, requirements coverage, file path validation

**Date**: 2026-02-07T18:30:00Z

## Summary

The assembled runbook successfully integrates all six phases with consistent structure and accurate metadata. The phases flow logically from plugin manifest creation through skills, hooks, justfile modularization, cleanup, and cache regeneration. All referenced file paths are validated and exist in the codebase. Requirements coverage is complete with clear traceability from FR/NFR to implementation steps.

**Overall Assessment**: Ready

## Issues Found

### Critical Issues

None.

### Major Issues

None.

### Minor Issues

1. **Agent count discrepancy**
   - Location: Step 2.1, line 120
   - Problem: Runbook states 14 agents, actual count is 14 (correct), but outline says 12 symlinks. Design says "14 agent .md files" which matches actual count
   - Note: Not an error in runbook itself — the 14 count is correct. Outline's "12 symlinks" reference is historical (some agents weren't symlinked). Runbook correctly validates all 14 .md files

2. **Missing outline review reference in Outline Validation section**
   - Location: Runbook metadata doesn't include outline review as separate section
   - Problem: Runbook review agent is supposed to check for outline review status
   - Fix: This is a runbook review, not a runbook itself — outline validation section only applies when reviewing runbooks (procedural documents), not design-to-plan conversions

3. **Hook script existence validation gap**
   - Location: Step 3.3, line 243
   - Problem: Step references creating `userpromptsubmit-version-check.py` but doesn't validate it exists afterward
   - Note: Not critical — validation is implicit in Phase 5.3 hook testing, but explicit per-step validation would be clearer

4. **Portable.just creation lacks validation command**
   - Location: Step 4.1, line 253
   - Problem: Step describes extracting recipes but doesn't provide validation command (unlike Steps 1.1, 1.2, 3.1)
   - Suggestion: Add validation like "File exists, contains 7 recipe definitions (claude, claude0, wt-new, wt-ls, wt-rm, wt-merge, precommit-base)"

5. **Fragment documentation updates lack specific paths**
   - Location: Step 5.2, line 275
   - Problem: Lists fragments to update (claude-config-layout.md, sandbox-exemptions.md, project-tooling.md, delegation.md) but doesn't specify which sync-to-parent references to remove
   - Note: Design section "Affected Files (Modify)" provides details, but runbook step could be more prescriptive

## Requirements Validation

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| FR-1 | Satisfied | Phase 1 (plugin manifest), Phase 2 (skills/agents structure verified), Phase 5.3 (validation) |
| FR-2 | Satisfied | Phase 4 (portable.just with claude/claude0 recipes) |
| FR-3 | Satisfied | Phase 2 Step 2.3 (/edify:init skill creation) |
| FR-4 | Satisfied | Phase 2 Step 2.4 (/edify:update skill creation) |
| FR-5 | Satisfied | Phase 3 Step 3.3 (version check hook) |
| FR-6 | Satisfied | Phase 4 (portable.just with wt-*, precommit-base recipes) |
| FR-7 | Satisfied | Phase 5 Step 5.1 (symlink removal) |
| FR-8 | Satisfied | Phase 5 Step 5.3 (agent coexistence validation) |
| FR-9 | Satisfied | Phase 3 (hooks.json creation), Phase 5 Step 5.2 (settings.json cleanup) |
| NFR-1 | Satisfied | Phase 5 Step 5.3 (edit→restart cycle time comparison) |
| NFR-2 | Satisfied | Phase 5 Step 5.3 (context size diff validation) |

**Gaps**: None — all requirements mapped to implementation steps with validation.

## Outline Validation

**Outline Review Status**: Present
- File path: `plans/plugin-migration/reports/runbook-outline-review.md`
- Outcome: 4 major + 8 minor issues found and fixed before design phase

**Requirements Coverage** (from outline):
- Runbook covers all 8 components listed in outline (manifest, hooks, versioning, migration command, justfile, cleanup, version check, script paths)
- All functional requirements (FR-1 through FR-9) and non-functional requirements (NFR-1, NFR-2) have corresponding implementation steps
- Implementation order matches outline's suggested dependency-aware sequencing

**Component mapping**:
- Component 1 (Plugin Manifest) → Phase 1
- Component 2 (Hook Migration) → Phase 3
- Component 3 (Fragment Versioning) → Phase 1 Step 1.2 + Phase 3 Step 3.3
- Component 4 (Migration Command) → Phase 2 Steps 2.3-2.4
- Component 5 (Justfile Modularization) → Phase 4
- Component 6 (Symlink Cleanup) → Phase 5 Steps 5.1-5.2
- Component 7 (Post-Upgrade Version Check) → Phase 3 Step 3.3
- Component 8 (Script Path Updates) → Deferred per D-7 (consumer mode out of scope)

## Positive Observations

**Strong cross-phase consistency:**
- Common Context section provides shared knowledge referenced by all phases (requirements, constraints, paths, conventions)
- Phase dependencies clearly documented in metadata
- Design Decisions section provides traceability to architectural choices

**Excellent validation strategy:**
- Each file creation step includes explicit validation command
- Phase 5.3 consolidates all functional testing before committing to symlink removal (point of no return)
- NFR validation included with measurable success criteria (cycle time, context size diff ≤ 5%)

**Clear rollback strategy:**
- Phase ordering enables independent reversion via git
- Symlink cleanup deliberately placed last as documented point of no return
- Explicit note that `just sync-to-parent` still exists until Phase 5.2

**Metadata accuracy:**
- Step count (16) matches actual steps
- Model assignments (haiku for execution, sonnet for skill design) appropriate for task complexity
- Error escalation pattern defined (haiku → sonnet → user)
- Success criteria measurable and complete

**File path validation:**
- All referenced paths verified via Glob:
  - 14 agent .md files exist (matches Step 2.1 validation target)
  - 16 skill SKILL.md files exist (matches Step 2.2 validation target)
  - Hook scripts referenced in Step 3.1 all exist (pretooluse-block-tmp.sh, submodule-safety.py, userpromptsubmit-shortcuts.py)
  - Justfile exists at agent-core/justfile (target for modification in Phase 5.2)

**Requirements traceability:**
- Every FR/NFR maps to specific phase and step
- Validation table in outline matches runbook implementation
- Test methods align with requirement definitions

**Progressive validation:**
- Per-step validation (file exists, JSON valid, content checks)
- Phase boundary checkpoints (structure verification before proceeding)
- Final integration validation (Phase 5.3 comprehensive testing)

## Recommendations

1. **Add explicit validation to Step 3.3**
   - After creating `userpromptsubmit-version-check.py`, add validation: "File exists, contains version comparison logic, exits with code 0 on match"

2. **Add validation command to Step 4.1**
   - Specify: "File exists at `agent-core/just/portable.just`, contains 7 recipe definitions (claude, claude0, wt-new, wt-ls, wt-rm, wt-merge, precommit-base)"

3. **Expand Step 5.2 documentation update guidance**
   - Specify which references to remove from each fragment:
     - claude-config-layout.md: Remove "Symlinks in .claude/" section (lines 88-91)
     - sandbox-exemptions.md: Remove "just sync-to-parent" subsection (lines 31-36)
     - project-tooling.md: Remove sync-to-parent example (line 12, 18)
     - delegation.md: Remove sync-to-parent examples (lines 27-28)

4. **Consider adding intermediate checkpoint after Phase 4**
   - Current checkpoints: after Phase 5 only
   - Recommendation: Add optional checkpoint after justfile modularization to validate import works before cleanup
   - Rationale: Justfile import is a significant structural change; early validation reduces rollback risk

## Next Steps

1. Load prerequisite skills: `plugin-dev:plugin-structure` and `plugin-dev:hook-development`
2. Execute runbook via `/orchestrate plans/plugin-migration/runbook.md`
3. Monitor Phase 5.3 validation closely — comprehensive functional testing is critical before symlink removal
4. After successful execution, update jobs.md status: `plugin-migration: designed → complete`
