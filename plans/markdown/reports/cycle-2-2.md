# Cycle 2.2 Execution Report

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-09

## Cycle Summary

- **Status:** GREEN_VERIFIED ✓
- **Test command:** `pytest tests/test_markdown_fixtures.py::test_preprocessor_fixture -v`
- **RED result:** Fixture files created successfully (test discovered both fixtures)
- **GREEN result:** PASS (both fixtures pass)
- **Regression check:** 415/415 passed (no regressions)
- **Refactoring:** None needed (precommit validation passed)

## Files Modified

- `tests/fixtures/markdown/02-inline-backticks.input.md` (created)
- `tests/fixtures/markdown/02-inline-backticks.expected.md` (created)

## Stop Condition

None - cycle completed successfully.

## Decision Made

No architectural decisions needed. Fixture created directly from test-corpus.md section 2 specifications, with expected output generated by running input through the preprocessor pipeline.

## Technical Notes

### Fixture Design

The 02-inline-backticks fixture covers all examples from test-corpus.md section 2:

**Input content:**
- Basic inline code with single backticks
- Double backtick quoting for code containing single backticks
- Triple backtick quoting for code containing double backticks
- Quadruple backtick quoting for code containing triple backticks (fence markers)
- Edge cases: empty spans, whitespace handling, adjacent code spans
- Backticks combined with other markdown (bold, italic, links)

**Preprocessor behavior verified:**

The `escape_inline_backticks()` function correctly:
1. Protects inline code spans delimited by 1-2 backticks
2. Escapes unprotected triple+ backticks by wrapping with double backticks and spaces
3. Adds spaces around backtick content when needed (via `fix_backtick_spaces()`)
4. Preserves valid inline code structure

**Key patterns in expected output:**
- `` ` `` at line 18: Single backtick with spaces for consistency
- `` ``` `` at line 26: Triple backtick escaping in unprotected text
- `` ```` `` at line 45: Quadruple backtick escaping in unprotected text
- Lines 8-9: Space quoting via `"` wrapping for leading/trailing spaces in code

### Test Discovery

The test parametrization in `test_markdown_fixtures.py` automatically discovered both fixtures:
- `_discover_fixture_names()` scans for `*.input.md` files
- Found: `01-nested-fences`, `02-inline-backticks`
- Test parametrized with both fixture names
- Test passed for both fixtures

### Validation Chain

1. **RED Phase:** Fixtures didn't exist initially → fixture discovery created parametrization for 02-inline-backticks
2. **GREEN Phase:** Both fixture files created → test passes with exact output match
3. **Regression Check:** Full suite (415 tests) passes → no regressions
4. **Lint/Precommit:** All validation passes → no quality issues
