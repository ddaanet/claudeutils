# Handoff Entry Point

## Current Status: Markdown Segment Processing - Complete ✅

- **Branch:** markdown
- **Issue:** ✅ RESOLVED - List detection now respects segment boundaries
- **Plan:** `plans/markdown-fence-aware-processing.md`
- **Progress:** Phases 1-5 complete ✅ (19 tests: 5+3+4+5+2)

### What's Done

**Core Issue Resolved:** Segment-aware processing prevents false positives in fenced blocks.

- ✅ Phase 1: Segment parser foundation (5 tests)
- ✅ Phase 2: Mixed content parsing (3 tests)
- ✅ Phase 3: Segment integration (4 tests)
- ✅ 12 new tests, 48/48 passing

**Result:** List detection and all fixes now skip content in ```python, ```yaml, ``` (bare), and YAML prolog sections. Python dicts, tables, and structured content no longer corrupted.

### What's Next

The markdown preprocessing pipeline is now complete. All phases have been implemented and tested:

- ✅ Phase 1: Segment parser foundation (5 tests)
- ✅ Phase 2: Mixed content parsing (3 tests)
- ✅ Phase 3: Segment integration (4 tests)
- ✅ Phase 4: Backtick space preservation (5 tests)
- ✅ Phase 5: Exception handling validation (2 tests)

**Next Steps:** Prepare PR and merge to main branch.

## What Was Completed (2026-01-05)

### Markdown Preprocessor Features

Implemented three major features plus bonus improvements:

1. **Generic prefix detection** - Extended fix_warning_lines to handle any consistent
   non-markup prefix (emoji, brackets, colons)
2. **Code block nesting** - Handle inner fences in ```markdown blocks using ````
3. **Metadata list indentation** - Convert labels to list items with proper nesting
4. **Inline backtick escaping** - Wrap `` ```language `` to prevent fence ambiguity
5. **Custom exception handling** - MarkdownProcessingError and MarkdownInnerFenceError

### Documentation

- ✅ Module docstrings explaining preprocessor purpose and pipeline
- ✅ README section with usage examples and what it fixes
- ✅ Function docstrings for all key functions
- ✅ TEST_DATA.md with input/output transformations
- ✅ DESIGN_DECISIONS.md with architecture rationale

### Test Coverage

- 40 total tests passing (32 markdown + 8 CLI)
- All features validated through TDD
- Exception handling and error reporting tested
