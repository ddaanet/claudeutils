# Agent Instructions and Configuration

This directory contains agent-related configuration and documentation.

## Overview

The `CLAUDE.md` file in the project root provides comprehensive instructions for how agents should behave within this project. It covers communication rules, delegation patterns, tool usage, and role definitions.

## Composition and Generation

`CLAUDE.md` is generated from shared fragments stored in the `agent-core` repository. This allows consistent agent instructions to be shared across multiple projects while remaining customizable per project.

### Source Fragments

The generated `CLAUDE.md` is composed from the following fragments (in order):

1. **AGENTS-framework.md** - File header and navigation links
2. **communication.md** - Core communication rules
3. **delegation.md** - Delegation principles and patterns
4. **tool-batching.md** - Guidelines for batching tool operations
5. **roles-rules-skills.md** - Tables defining roles, rules, and skills
6. **hashtags.md** - Semantic hashtag conventions

All fragments are sourced from `agent-core/fragments/`.

### Generation Script

**File**: `agents/compose.sh`

**Purpose**: Concatenates fragments to generate `CLAUDE.md`

**Usage**:
```bash
bash agents/compose.sh
```

**Configuration**:
- Fragment list: `compose.yaml`
- Fragment paths: Hard-coded in `compose.sh` (can evolve to YAML parsing in future)

## Customization

To customize agent instructions for this project:

1. **Add project-specific sections**: Edit `CLAUDE.md` directly for local customization
2. **Modify fragment order**: Update `compose.sh` fragment array and re-run generation
3. **Override shared rules**: Add project-specific rules before the composition step
4. **Document changes**: Keep this README updated with any project-specific patterns

## Integration with Justfile

The generation script can be called from justfile recipes:

```justfile
generate-agents:
    bash agents/compose.sh
```

## Version Control

- **CLAUDE.md**: Tracked in git (generated file, but committed for visibility)
- **compose.yaml**: Tracked in git (composition configuration)
- **compose.sh**: Tracked in git (generation script)
- **agent-core/**: Added as git submodule

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future phases:

- YAML parser for compose.yaml in compose.sh
- Template variables for project-specific customization
- Validation schema for generated CLAUDE.md
- CI/CD integration to validate composition on commit
- Fragment composition at import time (eliminating need to regenerate)
