# Memory Index

Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training knowledge.

Condensed knowledge catalog. Read referenced files when working in related areas.

**Consumption pattern:** This index is loaded via CLAUDE.md @-reference—it's already in your context. Do NOT grep or re-read this file. Scan the loaded content mentally, identify relevant entries, then Read the referenced file directly.

**File organization:** Sections are grouped by target file. The section heading specifies the file; entries within that section point to that file. When an entry is relevant, read the referenced file.

**Append-only.** Never remove or consolidate entries — each entry is a keyword-rich discovery surface for on-demand knowledge. Growth is bounded by consolidation rate (~5-10 entries/session) and total token cost is modest (200 entries ≈ 5000 tokens).

**Do not index content already loaded via CLAUDE.md.** Fragments referenced by `@` are in every conversation. Index entries for those add noise without aiding discovery. Only index knowledge that requires on-demand loading.




## Behavioral Rules (fragments — already loaded)

Delegation with context — don't delegate when context already loaded, token economy
Never auto-commit in interactive sessions — commit only on explicit request
Loaded skill overrides fresh-session framing — skill content is actionable, execute immediately
Design tables are binding constraints — read classifications literally, apply judgment where design permits
Header titles not index entries — index entries need keyword-rich descriptions not just title repetition
Skill rules placement: point of violation — place prohibitions at decision point

## Technical Decisions (mixed — check entry for specific file)

Minimal `__init__.py` — keep empty, prefer explicit imports from specific modules
Private helpers stay with callers — cohesion over extraction, clear module boundaries
Module split pattern — split large files by functional responsibility, maintain 400-line limit
Path encoding algorithm — simple slash to dash replacement with special root handling
History directory resolution — use claude projects encoded path as standard location
Title extraction — handle both string and array text blocks content formats
Title formatting — replace newlines with spaces, truncate to 80 chars with ellipsis
Trivial message detection — multi-layer filter with empty single-char slash commands keyword set
Feedback extraction layering — type filter, error check, interruption check, trivial filter priority
UUID session pattern — validate session files with regex filter agent and non-session
Sorted glob results — use sorted glob instead of raw, predictable test results
First-line parsing — parse only first JSONL line for session metadata, O(1)
Recursive pattern: AgentId → SessionId — agent IDs become session IDs for child agents
Agent ID extraction — extract agentId from first line, avoid repeated extraction
Graceful degradation — skip malformed entries, log warnings, continue processing partial data
Optional field defaults — use get field default for optional fields, graceful missing data
Pydantic for validation — use BaseModel for all data structures, type safety
FeedbackType enum — use StrEnum for feedback types, type-safe string constants
Docformatter vs. Ruff D205 conflict — shorten docstring summaries to fit 80 chars
Complexity Management — extract helper functions when cyclomatic complexity exceeds limits, refactor not suppress
No Suppression Shortcuts — fix linting issues properly instead of using noqa suppressions
Type Annotations — full type annotations in strict mypy mode, catch bugs early
Pipeline architecture — three-stage pipeline collect analyze rules for feedback processing
Filtering module as foundation — reusable is_noise and categorize_feedback functions, DRY principle
Noise detection patterns — multi-marker detection with length threshold for command outputs
Categorization by keywords — keyword-based category assignment with priority order for feedback
Deduplication strategy — first 100 characters as dedup key, case-insensitive prefix tracking
Stricter filtering for rules — additional filters beyond analyze for rule-worthy items
Model as first positional argument — required parameter for accurate token counts
Model alias support — hybrid approach with runtime probing fallback for unversioned aliases
Anthropic API integration — use official SDK with default environment variable handling
Empty file optimization — return zero for empty files without API call
No glob expansion (initial release) — defer pattern expansion to future, shell expansion sufficient
Markdown cleanup architecture — preprocessor fixes structure before dprint formatting for Claude output
Problem — Claude generates markdown with consecutive emoji lines and improper nesting
Solution — run markdown fixes before dprint, error on invalid patterns
Design decisions — extend fix_warning_lines for checklists, create new for code blocks
Extend vs. new functions — conceptual similarity vs fundamentally different block-based processing
Error on invalid patterns — prevents dprint failures, makes issues visible immediately
Processing order — line-based before block-based, spacing after structural changes
Prefix detection strategy — generic prefix detection not hard-coded patterns for adaptability
Indentation amount — two spaces for nested lists, standard markdown convention
Future direction — evolve to dprint plugin for single-pass processing
Remark-cli over Prettier — idempotent by design, CommonMark compliance, handles nested code blocks
Growth + consolidation model — append-only with no pruning or limits, keyword-rich discovery
Rule files for context injection — use claude rules with paths frontmatter for automatic loading
Premium/standard/efficient naming — opus sonnet haiku terminology instead of ambiguous T1 T2 T3
Multi-layer discovery pattern — surface skills via CLAUDE.md rules workflow reminders descriptions
Agent frontmatter YAML validation — use multi-line syntax for descriptions containing examples
Symlink persistence — verify symlinks after operations that reformat files like dev
Heredoc sandbox compatibility — export TMPPREFIX for zsh heredoc temp files in sandbox
Path.cwd() vs os.getcwd() — use Path.cwd() for consistency with pathlib usage
Error output pattern — print errors to stderr before exit one, Unix convention
Entry point configuration — add project scripts in pyproject for direct command usage
Feedback processing output formats — support both text and JSON formats for flexibility
Token output format — human-readable text by default, JSON with flag, include resolved model
Test module split strategy — mirror source module structure, separate CLI tests by subcommand
Mock patching pattern — patch where object is used not where defined
Testing strategy for markdown cleanup — TDD approach with red green cycles and integration tests
Success metrics — all tests pass, no regressions, clear errors, complete documentation
