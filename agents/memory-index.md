# Memory Index

Condensed knowledge catalog. Read referenced files when working in related areas.

**Append-only.** Never remove or consolidate entries — each entry is a keyword-rich discovery surface for on-demand knowledge. Growth is bounded by consolidation rate (~5-10 entries/session) and total token cost is modest (200 entries ≈ 5000 tokens).

**Do not index content already loaded via CLAUDE.md.** Fragments referenced by `@` are in every conversation. Index entries for those add noise without aiding discovery. Only index knowledge that requires on-demand loading.

## Behavioral Rules

- Tool batching unsolved
- Delegation with context
- Three-tier assessment

## Workflow Patterns

- Skill-loading directives
- Weak orchestrator pattern
- TDD workflow
- Handoff pattern
- Checkpoint process
- Commit verification
- TDD commit squashing
- Handoff tail-call
- Handoff commit assumption
- Single-layer complexity
## Technical Decisions

- Minimal init
- Private helpers cohesion
- Path encoding
- Pydantic for validation
- Complexity management
- Feedback processing
- Remark-cli chosen
- Memory index append-only
- Rule files pattern
- Premium standard efficient
- Skill discovery layers
- Agent frontmatter multiline
- Symlinks after formatters
- Heredocs in sandbox
