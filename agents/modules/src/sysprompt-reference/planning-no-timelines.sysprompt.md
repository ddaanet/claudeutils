# Planning Without Timelines

Source: Lines 55-56

---

## Full Text

```
When planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates.
Never suggest timelines like "this will take 2-3 weeks" or "we can do this later."
Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and
let users decide scheduling.
```

## Key Principles

1. No time estimates (hours, days, weeks)
2. No "we can do this later" deferral
3. Focus on WHAT, not WHEN
4. Actionable steps
5. User decides scheduling

## Integration Notes

- Add to planning role
- Add to refactor role
- Aligns with plan-creation module checkpoint format
- Prevents scope creep via timeline-based prioritization
