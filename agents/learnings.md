# Learnings

Institutional knowledge accumulated across sessions. Append new learnings at the bottom.

**Soft limit: 80 lines.** When approaching this limit, use `/remember` to consolidate older learnings into permanent documentation (behavioral rules → `agent-core/fragments/*.md`, technical details → `agents/decisions/*.md` or `agents/decisions/implementation-notes.md`). Keep the 3-5 most recent learnings for continuity.

## When visible primitives enable decomposition
- Anti-pattern: Loading all justfile recipes into agent context via @-reference — primitives (wt-rm, wt-merge) visible alongside skills that wrap them
- Correct pattern: Curate in-context recipe list to essential commands only. Primitives exist as fallback but aren't in agent's active context
- Rationale: Agent reads skill, understands internals, selects "simpler" primitive that lacks side effects (session.md updates). Rule additions fail (4 instances same pattern) because rules compete for attention. Structural fix: reduce primitive visibility
- Fix: CLAUDE.md @.cache/just-help*.txt → inline 5-recipe list; removed cache infrastructure entirely
## When shortcuts bypass upstream steps
- Anti-pattern: Pre-evaluating whether a shortcut's chain has work to do (e.g., `hc` → check git status → clean → skip handoff entirely)
- Correct pattern: Invoke the expansion directly. Each step in the chain creates preconditions for the next. Checking downstream preconditions before running upstream steps aborts chains that would have succeeded.
- Same class as "execute directly" deviation — premature termination of multi-step chains based on downstream precondition evaluation
- Fix: execute-rule.md Tier 1 shortcuts section: "Shortcuts are mechanical expansions — invoke directly. Do not pre-evaluate."
## When execute directly skips safety
- Anti-pattern: Design skill triage → "Simple → execute directly" → skip skill checks, recipe checks, cwd rules
- Correct pattern: "Execute directly" means skip design ceremony, not skip operational rules. Skill-check-first and recipe-check-first still apply.
- Root cause: "Simple" classification creates execution mode that optimizes throughput by rationalizing away ALL friction, not just design-level ceremony
- Fix: Design skill Simple path updated to say "Check for applicable skills and project recipes first, then execute directly"
## When orchestrator handles review delegation
- Anti-pattern: Step validation sections say "Delegate to skill-reviewer" expecting execution agent to spawn plugin-dev agents
- Correct pattern: Orchestrator delegates reviews from main session after execution agents commit
- Rationale: Sub-agents can't spawn plugin-dev agents (skill-reviewer, agent-creator). Orchestrator has plugin-dev access, execution agents don't. Validation delegation is orchestrator responsibility, not execution agent responsibility.
## When deliverable review catches drift
- Anti-pattern: Relying solely on per-step vet reviews for quality assurance
- Correct pattern: Post-orchestration deliverable review catches inter-file consistency gaps (stale copies, broken references, missing cross-references) that per-step vet misses
- Evidence: memory-index skill drifted during execution (3 entries missing); workflows-terminology.md referenced non-existent agent; runbook skill missing general-patterns.md reference
- These were invisible to per-step vet because each step's artifacts were internally consistent
