# Session Handoff: 2026-01-24

**Status:** TDD workflow enhanced with delegated review; Composition API runbook needs revision

## Completed This Session

**TDD workflow enhancement:**
- Updated agent-core: Added delegated review step to /plan-tdd workflow and skill (9df24a1)
- Updated workflow docs: TDD planning now includes clean sonnet agent review before runbook finalization
- Committed submodule update (aa054da) and settings.json permissions (6693580)
- Review criteria: completeness, executability, context sufficiency, test sequencing (ensures RED), implementation hints

**Composition API TDD runbook created:**
- Generated draft runbook: 11 cycles, 47 tests batched in logical groups (64815ab)
- Structure: Phase 1 (text utilities), Phase 2 (config loading), Phase 3 (core composition), Phase 4 (CLI)
- Delegated to clean sonnet agent for review (agent af16292)

**Review findings (NEEDS REVISION):**
- Review report: plans/unification/consolidation/reports/runbook-review.md
- **Critical**: RED/GREEN violations in 6/11 cycles (55%) - tests will pass immediately
- **Root cause**: Cycles 3.1, 4.1 implement too much upfront (all params, error handling, options)
- **Also found**: CLI naming bug (compose_cmd vs compose), exit code inconsistency, invalid YAML anchor test

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] **Apply review feedback to runbook** (IMMEDIATE)
  - Restructure Cycles 2.1, 3.1, 4.1 to minimal implementations (happy path only)
  - Move features to later cycles for proper RED/GREEN sequencing
  - Fix CLI command naming (compose_cmd → compose or add @main.command(name='compose'))
  - Fix exit code mapping (FileNotFoundError should be exit 2, not 4)
  - Remove/fix invalid YAML anchor test (line 451-467)
  - Add implementation sequencing hints to prevent premature feature implementation

- [ ] **Execute revised runbook** (AFTER FIXES)
  - Run prepare-runbook.py to generate execution artifacts
  - Use /orchestrate for TDD cycle execution
  - Follow strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR discipline

## Blockers / Gotchas

**Runbook revision required before execution:**
- Current runbook violates TDD RED/GREEN discipline in majority of cycles
- Must restructure implementations to be incremental (not all-at-once)
- See review report for detailed restructuring guidance with code examples

**Key learning:** When planning TDD runbooks, resist implementing full signatures/features in early cycles. Build truly incrementally:
- Cycle X.1: Happy path only, minimal params, no error handling
- Cycle X.2+: Add one feature at a time to ensure proper RED phase

## Next Steps

**Immediate:** Apply review feedback to fix RED/GREEN violations and critical bugs in runbook. Use review report's "Specific Recommendations" section (lines 586-748) as implementation guide.

**After revision:** Commit revised runbook, run prepare-runbook.py, execute with /orchestrate.

## Recent Learnings

**Delegated review process (new):**
- /plan-tdd now includes automatic review by clean sonnet agent before finalization
- Review catches RED/GREEN violations, missing context, ambiguous instructions
- Implementation hints ensure correct sequencing for proper test-first behavior
- This session validated the review process - caught 6 critical issues before execution

**TDD runbook anti-pattern identified:**
- **Anti-pattern**: Implementing complete function signatures with all params/options in first cycle
- **Correct pattern**: Start with absolute minimum (1-2 params, happy path), add features one cycle at a time
- Example: compose(fragments, output) in Cycle 3.1, then add title in 3.2, adjust_headers in 3.3, etc.

**Review criteria for TDD runbooks:**
1. Completeness - all design features covered
2. Executability - clear, actionable instructions
3. Context sufficiency - adequate info for isolated execution
4. Test sequencing - tests RED before GREEN (critical!)
5. Implementation hints - sequencing guidance when critical
