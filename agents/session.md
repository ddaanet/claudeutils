# Session: Worktree — Markdown test corpus

**Status:** Scoping complete, ready for design.

## Completed This Session

- [x] **Scope markdown test corpus work** — Gap analysis + requirements document
  - Analyzed 77 existing unit tests vs 12-section test corpus — found 6 corpus sections with no tests, no end-to-end pipeline tests, no fixture-based testing
  - Wrote `plans/markdown/requirements.md` with 5 FRs and recommended approach (fixture files + parametrized pytest)

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] **Design markdown test corpus** — `/design plans/markdown/requirements.md`
  - Plan: markdown | Status: requirements (scoped)

## Reference Files

- **plans/markdown/requirements.md** — Requirements with gap analysis, 5 FRs, approach recommendation
- **plans/markdown/test-corpus.md** — Edge case reference document (12 sections)
