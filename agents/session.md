# Session: Worktree — Continuation passing design

**Status:** Focused worktree for parallel execution.

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] **Continuation passing design** — Validate outline against requirements | opus
  - Plan: continuation-passing | Status: requirements

## Blockers / Gotchas

**Key dependency chain:** continuation-passing → handoff-validation → orchestrate-evolution (serial opus sessions)

**orchestrate-evolution missing from jobs.md** — needs entry added after this design completes.

## Reference Files

- **agents/jobs.md** — Plan status tracking
- **agents/session.md** — Main session context

## Next Steps

Start with `/design plans/continuation-passing/problem.md` or validate existing outline.
