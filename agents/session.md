# Session: Worktree — Update design skill

**Status:** Task complete. Ready to merge back.

## Completed This Session

- [x] **Update design skill** — Three changes to `agent-core/skills/design/SKILL.md`:
  - C.2 Checkpoint Commit: New step between C.1 and C.3 to commit design before vet review
  - C.4 → "Check for Unfixable Issues": Clarified vet agent applies fixes directly, step handles UNFIXABLE residual only
  - Execution model directives: Opus required for workflow/skill/agent edits, parallel to plugin-dev directives

## Reference Files

- **agent-core/skills/design/SKILL.md** — Design skill (modified)
- **tmp/vet-design-skill.md** — Vet report (all issues fixed, no UNFIXABLE)
