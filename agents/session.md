# Session: Worktree — Analyze parity test quality failures

**Status:** Design complete. Ready for planning.

## Completed This Session

- RCA review analyzing D+B hybrid fix impact on 5 gaps (`plans/reflect-rca-parity-iterations/rca-review.md`)
- Opus critical review of RCA review (`rca-review-critique.md`) — 9 findings
- Pipeline exploration report (`reports/explore-pipeline.md`)
- Outline produced, reviewed (outline-review-agent), iterated with user feedback, validated (`outline.md`)
- Design document produced (`plans/reflect-rca-parity-iterations/design.md`) — 8 design decisions (DD-1 through DD-8), 3-tier sequencing, reviewed by design-vet-agent (Ready, 0 critical, 2 major + 1 minor all fixed)

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] **Plan parity gap fixes** — `/plan-adhoc plans/reflect-rca-parity-iterations/design.md`
  - Plan: reflect-rca-parity-iterations | Status: designed

## Blockers / Gotchas
