# Session Handoff: 2026-03-01

**Status:** Branch deliverable-reviewed. Execute-skill-dispatch: 0 critical, 1 major (private API import), 3 minor. Fix task pending.

## Completed This Session

**Planstate detector fix:**
- Added `outlined` status to `_determine_status()` in `src/claudeutils/planstate/inference.py` — slots between `designed` and `requirements`
- Added `outlined` → `/runbook plans/{name}/outline.md` next-action template
- 3 new test cases in `tests/test_planstate_inference.py` (outline-only, outline+requirements, design+outline priority)
- Cleaned up test parametrize: removed unused `status` label field from 2 parametrize blocks (411→387 lines)
- Updated 3 enumeration sites: execute-rule.md, handoff/SKILL.md, prioritize/SKILL.md
- Precommit green: 1367 passed, 1 xfail

**Process deviation RCA:**
- Agent bypassed `/design` skill when `#execute` picked up task — implemented directly without recall pass
- Root cause: execute-rule MODE 2 says "start first pending task" without explicit skill invocation instruction
- Pattern match: "When Execution Routing Preempts Skill Scanning" (structural fix needed, not prose)
- Captured requirements: `plans/execute-skill-dispatch/requirements.md`

**TDD discipline review:**
- Batched all test changes in single RED phase, only verified one failure
- `designed_with_outline` was never RED — characterization test added as if TDD
- Learning captured: one acceptance criterion per RED→GREEN cycle

**Execute-skill-dispatch triage:**
- `/design` classified as Moderate (both axes high, behavioral code in FR-2 hook logic)
- Wrote `plans/execute-skill-dispatch/classification.md`
- Routed to `/runbook` — skip design, requirements are mechanism-specified

**Execute-skill-dispatch implementation:**
- Tier 2 assessment: 5 TDD cycles + 1 general step, lightweight delegation
- FR-2: Added `_extract_execute_command()`, `_try_planstate_command()`, `_extract_plan_name()` to UPS hook
- Hook parses `agents/session.md` when `x` fires, extracts first eligible task command, injects `Invoke: <command>` into additionalContext
- Priority: in-progress `[>]` over pending `[ ]`; planstate-derived commands override session.md static commands (lazy import, C-1 performance safe)
- FR-1/FR-3: execute-rule.md MODE 2 updated — "Invoke the task's backtick command" with "Do not reinterpret" clause
- Tests extracted to `tests/test_userpromptsubmit_execute.py` (7 tests: injection, filtering, priority, fallback, planstate, backward-compat)
- Corrector review: 4 minor fixes (docstring accuracy, fixture character, assertion strength, C-3 backward-compat test)
- Precommit green: 1373 passed, 1 xfail

**Deliverable review (execute-skill-dispatch):**
- Reviewed 7 files (+276/-35 lines) against requirements.md baseline
- Layer 2 only (< 500 lines threshold)
- Major: `_try_planstate_command` imports private `_determine_status`/`_derive_next_action` — should use public `infer_state()` API
- Minor: `infer_state` docstring omits `lifecycle`, no `r` mode backward-compat test, fragile split assertion
- Report: `plans/execute-skill-dispatch/reports/deliverable-review.md`
- Lifecycle: `reviewed` (no critical findings)

## Pending Tasks

- [x] **Review skill dispatch** — `/deliverable-review plans/execute-skill-dispatch` | opus | restart
- [ ] **Fix dispatch findings** — `/design plans/execute-skill-dispatch/reports/deliverable-review.md` | opus

## Next Steps

Fix task routes through `/design` for proportional triage. Branch work otherwise complete.
