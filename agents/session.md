# Session Handoff: 2026-01-19

**Status:** Phase 3 (composition API design) complete and ready for Phase 4 implementation

## Completed This Session
- Executed Phase 3 with all 5 design steps (sonnet delegations)
- Step 1: Feature extraction from tuick (10+ features) and emojipack
- Step 2: Core module design (5 public functions, detailed algorithm)
- Step 3: CLI interface design (subcommands, arguments, pyproject.toml)
- Step 4: YAML schema design (validation rules, 5 examples)
- Step 5: Unified compose-api.md (115K integrated design document)
- All execution reports written to plans/unification/reports/phase3-step-*.md

## Pending Tasks
- Execute Phase 4 (implement composition module and CLI)
- Continue with Phase 5+ planning or execution

## Blockers / Gotchas
- None

## Next Steps
Phase 4 is ready to execute. Design is complete with all 3 major sections documented. Next agent should review compose-api.md and begin implementation of core module, CLI, and YAML validation.
