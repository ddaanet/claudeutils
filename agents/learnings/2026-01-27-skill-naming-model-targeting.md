**Skill naming for model targeting:**
- Anti-pattern: -lite suffix implying "less features" when targeting different models
- Correct pattern: Name reflects purpose (handoff-lite = efficient model target, commit-context = context-aware behavior)
- Rationale: handoff-lite targets efficient models while commit-lite would be confusing (implies fewer features, not model targeting)
