**Three-stream problem documentation:**
- Pattern: Document parallel work streams with problem.md (analysis) + session.md (design proposals)
- Benefits: Enables async prioritization - user can select stream without re-discovering context
- Structure: plans/<stream-name>/{problem.md, session.md} pattern scales well
- Example: Handoff skill, model awareness, and plan-tdd improvements all documented in parallel from single TDD session
