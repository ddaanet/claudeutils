**Learnings → skill references (not docs):**
- Anti-pattern: Consolidate learnings to CLAUDE.md/design-decisions.md (low discoverability, always loaded)
- Correct pattern: Consolidate to skill reference files (progressive disclosure, loaded when skill triggers)
- Rationale: Skills have discoverability via triggering; docs require grep
