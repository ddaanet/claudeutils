# Session Notes

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This file is for SHORT-TERM context only**

This file tracks:

- **Current work** in the active session
- **Pending tasks** that are queued up
- **Recently completed** tasks (last 1-2 sessions) for immediate context

**DO NOT** keep long-lived data here. Once tasks are complete and documented elsewhere
(DESIGN_DECISIONS.md, TEST_DATA.md, etc.), flush them from this file.

**Lifecycle:**

- Add tasks when starting work
- Update status as work progresses
- Move completed work to permanent docs
- Flush from here when no longer needed for immediate context
